/*-----------------------------
 WorkoutEnvironment class (dynamic arrays)

 A person (Buddy) needs to go to an env (WorkoutEnvironemnt) to do workouts.
 In order to start doing workouts, he needs to register at the env, which requires an entry fee.
 Afterwards, he can do all the workouts that the env has.

 Moreover, doing workouts consumes a lot of energy, thus he can't do more workouts if he doesn't have enough energy. In this case, he may need to have some Relaxations, and he will be filled with determination (energy)
